Enhancement requests
--------------------
* Make "LINUX RESTART" states visible in the graphs or add a note about it and if there is a sosreport tree available
  verify the reboots as they are not always captured by sar with a "LINUX RESTART"

* What to do with N/A values

* For every description add the exact kernel counter involved w/ proc path and also
  add a proper comprehensible explanation. For example in 'loadavg-1' add explanation
  when a load is high and how it relates to the number of CPUs

* Add graph unit in metadata and labels

* Test sar files where the collection interval is 1 or 2 minutes
