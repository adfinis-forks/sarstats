Enhancement requests
--------------------
* For every description add the exact kernel counter involved w/ proc path and also
  add a proper comprehensible explanation. For example in 'loadavg-1' add explanation
  when a load is high and how it relates to the number of CPUs

* Add graph unit in metadata and labels

* Test sar files where the collection interval is 1 or 2 minutes

* Add the possibility to add custom graphs with --custom 'foo:loadavg-1,i001/s'. This would add
  a page with both graphs. This can help correlation tasks
